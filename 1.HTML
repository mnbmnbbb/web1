    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the
    standard markup Language for
    <strong>sreating <u>web</u> pages</strong>
    and web applications.</P>

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML documents are delivered as
      "documents".[note 1] These are then parsed, which turns them into
      the Document Object Model (DOM) internal representation, within the web browser.
      [note 2][note 3] Presentation by the web browser (such as screen rendering or access by JavaScript)
       is then performed on this internal DOM, not the original document.</p>

    <p>Early HTML documents (and to a lesser extent today's HTML documents)
     were largely invalid HTML and riddled with syntax errors. The parsing process
     was also required to "fix" these errors as best it could. The result was often
     not correct (i.e., it did not represent what a careless coder had originally intended) but was
     at least valid according to the HTML standard. Only in the rarest cases would
     the parser abandon parsing altogether.</p>
